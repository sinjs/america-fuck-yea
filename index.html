      O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hail’d at
      the twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through
      the perilous fight O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly
      streaming? And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave
      proof through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that
      star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of
      the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the
      foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the
      breeze, o’er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half
      discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, In full
      glory reflected now shines in the stream, ’Tis the star-spangled banner -
      O long may it wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
      And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and
      the battle’s confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their
      blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution. No refuge could save
      the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the
      grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O’er the land of
      the free and the home of the brave. O thus be it ever when freemen shall
      stand Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation! Blest with
      vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land Praise the power that hath
      made and preserv’d us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is
      just, And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” And the star-spangled
      banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the
      brave.
